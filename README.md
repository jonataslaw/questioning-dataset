# questioning-dataset
A dataset of questions/answers to train IA models

This dataset was used to train this Flan-T5-large model that has nice results: https://huggingface.co/Jonnylaw/flan-t5-large

Even models with more parameters than the flan-t5-large, do not do well with questions and answers, as you can see a much larger model, cannot answer basic questions, such as who was the first president of the USA: https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xl?text=Who+was+the+first+president+of+United+States%3F

The answers were made one by one from several topics (mostly science, which is what I master)
